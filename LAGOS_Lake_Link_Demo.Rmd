This notebook will show some examples of the complex relationships that can be found in the LAGOS Lake Link (lake identifier crosswalk) as well as examples of problems that could possibly be solved with some more work. For a more detailed introduction to LAGOS Lake Link and a description of the creation process, see the document "LAGOS Lake Link: Creation"

# Definitions in this document
"Lake": Permanent lake or reservoir.

# What is LAGOS Lake Link?
LAGOS Lake Link is a tabular dataset (a crosswalk table) that can be used to connect one lake-related dataset to another for many common lake datasets. Several lake datasets are in common use on their own or as a base for scientific data products and LAGOS Lake Link is intended to make it easier to combine lake-related data between multiple sources. The table can be searched to find identifiers and location for a particular lake, or it can be used in data join operations to convert identifiers en masse. 

# Data dictionary
```{r}
data_dictionary <- read_csv("LAGOS_Lake_Link_data_dictionary.csv")
knitr::kable(data_dictionary, "html")
```

  mutate(gnis_id = as.integer(gnis_id))

```

Preview of the crosswalk table. As a reminder, there are **`r xwalk %>% distinct(lagoslakeid) %>% count() %>% pull()` LAGOS-US lakes**.
```{r}
glimpse(xwalk, width = 100)
```

# 1:1 relationships, or, "easy ones"
A large proportion of lakes connect easily and don't split or merge polygons over time. The crosswalk has all lakes greater than or equal to 1 hectare, but some of those are too small to be in the NHDPlusv2, so let's only check lakes greater than or equal to 4 hectares.
```{r}
lagos_lake_count_4ha <- xwalk %>% 
  filter(nhdhr_areasqkm >= 0.04) %>%
  distinct(lagoslakeid) %>%
  nrow()
count_easy <- xwalk %>%
  filter(nhdhr_areasqkm >= 0.04) %>%
  filter(count_lagos_per_lagosne_id <= 1 & # LAGOS-NE only has partial coverage so 0 is just fine
           count_lagos_per_nhdplusv2_id == 1 &
           count_lagosne_per_lagos_id == 1 &
           count_nhdplusv2_per_lagos_id == 1) %>%
  distinct(lagoslakeid) %>%
  nrow()

pct1 <- round(100*count_easy/lagos_lake_count_4ha, 0)
```
**`r pct1`% of lakes are very simple!** They may have multiple WQP sites, which is a bit more intuitive than the other 1: many relationships.

Here is an example lake. Bask in its comforting consistency, because things are about to get more complex.
```{r}
xwalk %>% filter(lagoslakeid == 1)
```

Equally simple, a large proportion of lakes have no matches for anything. Here is an example:
```{r}
xwalk %>% filter(lagoslakeid == 256832)
```

# 1:many relationship exploration

## LAGOS-US & WQP
```{r}
(n_lagos_wqp <- xwalk %>%
  mutate(Number_of_wqp_sites_per_lagos_lake = case_when(count_wqp_per_lagos_id == 0 ~ '0', count_wqp_per_lagos_id == 1 ~ '1', count_wqp_per_lagos_id > 1 ~ '>1')) %>%
  distinct(Number_of_wqp_sites_per_lagos_lake, lagoslakeid) %>%
  count(Number_of_wqp_sites_per_lagos_lake)
)
```

Out of the lakes that have a WQP sampling site, about half of them have more than one site within. In total, **`r n_lagos_wqp %>% filter(Number_of_wqp_sites_per_lagos_lake != '0') %>% tally() %>% pull()`** LAGOS lakes have WQP sites linked. The initial release of LAGOS-US will increase the number of links available, due to the inclusion of a manual linking process designed to review sampling location information.

### Examples of lakes with more than one WQP site
This is what a user will see in the crosswalk that should indicate to them that multiple WQP sites are found within a lake. This lake has 10 sites. The lake information is duplicated for every site (i.e., the crosswalk table is not normalized).
```{r}
(ex1 <- xwalk %>% filter(lagoslakeid == 3476))
```

If the lake also joins to multiple other lakes in either the NHDPlusv2 or LAGOS-NE, the user will see something like this. This site has 7 WQP sites and 2 NHDPlusv2 polygons for a total of 14 rows in the crosswalk. It's not possible (currently) to tell which WQP sites go with which NHDPlusv2 polygon. Now both lake and WQP information are duplicated.
```{r}
(ex2 <- xwalk %>% filter(lagoslakeid == 4069))
```

### How many WQP sites didn't link to a LAGOS Lake?
```{r}
load('./rdata/wqp_sf.RData')
wqp_no_link <- wqp_sf %>%
  anti_join(distinct(xwalk, wqp_monitoringlocationidentifier), by = c("MonitoringLocationIdentifier" = "wqp_monitoringlocationidentifier"))
```
`r nrow(wqp_no_link)` out of `r nrow(wqp_sf)` sites did not link (`r round(100*nrow(wqp_no_link)/nrow(wqp_sf),0)`%).

### Selected regional map of sites that didn't link.
As you can see, Great Lakes sites don't always have the "Great Lake" designation in the WQP and we are fine with these sites not linking.

```{r}
wqp_no_link %>% 
  filter(startsWith(HUCEightDigitCode,'0406')) %>%
  select(MonitoringLocationIdentifier, MonitoringLocationName, MonitoringLocationDescriptionText, MonitoringLocationTypeName) %>%
  mapview()
```

I would like to ask the limnologists: **What do you make of these samples clustered around large lakes?** The point is on the intended site as you can tell by looking at where the indicated township section would be. What are they sampling here? Should it be linked along with the other lake water quality samples? 

We could improve some of the WQP matches by doing a "closest" join and enforcing a requirement for shared words.


## LAGOS-US & NHDPlusv2
NHDPlusv2 within LAGOS Lake:
```{r}
(count_lagos_nhd <- xwalk %>%
  mutate(number_of_nhdplusv2_per_lagos_lake = case_when(count_nhdplusv2_per_lagos_id == 0 ~ '0', count_nhdplusv2_per_lagos_id == 1 ~ '1', count_nhdplusv2_per_lagos_id > 1 ~ '>1')) %>%
  distinct(number_of_nhdplusv2_per_lagos_lake, lagoslakeid) %>%
  count(number_of_nhdplusv2_per_lagos_lake)
)
```
And vice versa:
```{r}
(count_nhd_lagos <- xwalk %>%
  mutate(Number_of_LAGOS_Lakes_per_NHDPlusv2 = case_when(count_lagos_per_nhdplusv2_id == 0 ~ '0', count_lagos_per_nhdplusv2_id == 1 ~ '1', count_lagos_per_nhdplusv2_id > 1 ~ '>1')) %>%
  distinct(Number_of_LAGOS_Lakes_per_NHDPlusv2, lagoslakeid) %>%
  count(Number_of_LAGOS_Lakes_per_NHDPlusv2) %>%
   filter(!is.na(Number_of_LAGOS_Lakes_per_NHDPlusv2))
)
```
Note that "0" doesn't appear in the table because any NHDPlusv2 lake that appears in the table must be linked to at least one LAGOS-US lake, by definition of the table. It seems it's more common for NHDPlusv2 lakes to split into multiple LAGOS-US lakes than the other way around, but both occur. Occurs rarely: less than 1% of lakes.

### Missing LAGOS-NHDPlusv2 connections

A large proportion of LAGOS lakes have no NHDPlusv2 lake connection, but I don't actually expect that the smallest lakes would be found in the NHD medium-resolution. Check it out using a **size cutoff of 10 hectares**, which is more than large enough to appear in both.
```{r}
(count_lagos_nhd_4ha <- xwalk %>%
   filter(nhdhr_areasqkm >= 0.1) %>%
  mutate(Number_of_NHDPlusv2_per_LAGOS_Lake_over10ha = case_when(count_nhdplusv2_per_lagos_id == 0 ~ '0', count_nhdplusv2_per_lagos_id == 1 ~ '1', count_nhdplusv2_per_lagos_id > 1 ~ '>1')) %>%
  distinct(Number_of_NHDPlusv2_per_LAGOS_Lake_over10ha, lagoslakeid) %>%
  count(Number_of_NHDPlusv2_per_LAGOS_Lake_over10ha)
)
```
Still, **over 1/5 of 10-hectare lakes have no connection**. We decreased the size of this gap by about 5 percentage points (nearly 20,000 lakes) by including a spatial join in our methodology. However, these two NHD products include features mapped at very different times, and visual inspection of the remaining unlinked features reveals several common explanations.

1) Natural hydrologic regime change over time
2) Anthropogenic hydrologic change (such as new construction)
3) Re-classification of water features in the NHD. (A LakePond feature is revised to a StreamRiver polygon, a SwampMarsh feature to a LakePond ,etc.)
4) Minimum mapping unit differences
5) Ambiguous splits and merges. In order to retain high confidence in the links seen is this table, many seemingly valid split/merge links were excluded by choosing a uniform and conservative linking threshold based on the percentage overlap between "old" and "new" lakes.

The figures are slightly better when we look only at all lakes with a WQP site.
```{r}
xwalk %>%
  filter(count_wqp_per_lagos_id > 0) %>%
  mutate(Number_of_NHDPlusv2_per_LAGOS_Lake_withWQP = case_when(count_nhdplusv2_per_lagos_id == 0 ~ '0', count_nhdplusv2_per_lagos_id == 1 ~ '1', count_nhdplusv2_per_lagos_id > 1 ~ '>1')) %>%
  distinct(Number_of_NHDPlusv2_per_LAGOS_Lake_withWQP, lagoslakeid) %>%
  count(Number_of_NHDPlusv2_per_LAGOS_Lake_withWQP) %>%
  mutate(pct = round(100*n/sum(n), 2))
```

### Examples of each
This is what a user will see in the crosswalk that should indicate to them that multiple NHDPlusv2 lakes have been condensed to a single LAGOS-US lake. This lake has 4 NHDPlusv2 connections and 2 WQP sites, so 8 rows appear.
```{r}
xwalk %>% filter(count_nhdplusv2_per_lagos_id > 3 & count_nhdplusv2_per_lagos_id <5) %>% sample_n(10)

xwalk %>% filter(lagoslakeid == 2107)
```

This is what a user will see in the crosswalk that should indicate to them that 1 NHDPlusv2 lake has been split into multiple LAGOS-US lakes. These 4 lagos lakes used to be 1 NHDPlusv2 lake. 1 of them has 4 WQP sites, while the others have none, resulting in 7 rows appearing. Searching by lagoslakeid alone will not indicate the related lakes, of course.
```{r}
xwalk %>% filter(nhdplusv2_comid == '18469416')
```

## LAGOS-US & LAGOS-NE
The relationships seen here bear a strong resemblence to those seen with the NHDPlusv2, above. This table compares only lakes for the 17-state LAGOS-NE region.
```{r}
lagos_ne_states <- c('ME', 'NH', 'VT', 'CT', 'RI', 'NY', 'PA', 'NY', 'OH', 'NJ', 'IN', 'IL', 'MI', 'WI', 'IA', 'MN', 'MO')
(count_ne_per_us <- xwalk %>%
  filter(lagos_state %in% lagos_ne_states) %>%
  mutate(Number_of_NE_per_US_Lake = case_when(count_lagosne_per_lagos_id == 0 ~ '0', count_lagosne_per_lagos_id == 1 ~ '1', count_lagosne_per_lagos_id > 1 ~ '>1')) %>%
  distinct(Number_of_NE_per_US_Lake, lagoslakeid) %>%
  count(Number_of_NE_per_US_Lake)
)

```

And vice versa:
```{r}
(count_us_per_ne <- xwalk %>%
  filter(lagos_state %in% lagos_ne_states) %>%
  mutate(Number_of_US_per_NE_Lake = case_when(count_lagos_per_lagosne_id == 0 ~ '0', count_lagos_per_lagosne_id == 1 ~ '1', count_lagos_per_lagosne_id > 1 ~ '>1')) %>%
  distinct(Number_of_US_per_NE_Lake, lagoslakeid) %>%
  count(Number_of_US_per_NE_Lake) %>%
   filter(!is.na(Number_of_US_per_NE_Lake))
)
```
Again, "0" does not appear on the left of this table, by definition.

### Example: maximum complexity
Here's what happens when not only is a LAGOS-US lake associated with multiple LAGOS-NE lake polygons, but also when it has multiples of _everything_. This lake has 2 WQP sites, was once 4 LAGOS-NE lakes, and is associated with 5 NHDPlusv2 lakes (3 through ReachCode, and 2 via spatial join). It's not possibly to untangle which sample sites are where or how the LAGOS-NE lakes might relate to the NHDPlusv2 lakes, currently. 40 rows appear for this lake.
```{r}
xwalk %>% filter(lagoslakeid == 268427)
```

# Searching by name
It is possible to use names to search through all available information in the crosswalk if you build the right sort of function. I have done so in the setup code at the top of this document. Here are the results for the search term 'Cochituate'. This is a chain of lakes known as Lake Cochituate. Even though the NHD doesn't identify all of them by name, the linked WQP sites indicate the association.

```{r}
find_lake_word(xwalk, 'Cochituate')
```


# Appendix: Useful bits of code for exploration (INTERNAL USE)
This chunk identifies lakes with a missing NHDPlusv2 connection.
```{r}
missing_nhdplusV2 <- xwalk %>%
  filter(nhdhr_areasqkm >= 0.1) %>%
  filter(count_nhdplusv2_per_lagos_id < 1) %>%
  filter(lagoslakeid < 5000) %>%
  select(-wqp_monitoringlocationidentifier, -wqp_monitoringlocationname, -wqp_providername) %>%
  distinct()
```

And with the help of ArcMap to find equivalent lakes visually, this bit of code helps search for the cause of the missing link.
```{r}
load('./rdata/nhd_xref.RData')
# slow but effective
search_nhd_xref <- function(codes, depth = 1) {
  list_results <- lapply(codes, function(x) filter(nhd_xref, OldReachCode == x | NewReachCode == x))
  df1 <- do.call("rbind", list_results)
  if (depth == 2) {
    codes =  c(pull(df1, OldReachCode), pull(df1, NewReachCode))
    list_results2 <- lapply(codes, function(x) filter(nhd_xref, OldReachCode == x | NewReachCode == x))
    df2 <- do.call("rbind", list_results)
  } else {
    df2 <- df1
  }
  return(df2)
}

(result <- search_nhd_xref(c('04050001011691','04050001016492'), depth = 2) %>%
    mutate(OldReachCode = as.character(OldReachCode), NewReachCode = as.character(NewReachCode)))

# need to have nhd_plus_orig object loaded
#nhd_plus_orig %>% filter(REACHCODE %in% pull(result, OldReachCode))

```
